What is Hooks ?

Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React Features in functional components.
Earlier, When we used to create react app using functional components, then we didn't have the access to the 
state manangement and lifecycle methods.

To access these features we have to add the class components

So this was the problem of functional components.

But after introducing the React Hooks from version 16.8 , we can use state manangement and other react features
without writing class components

In other words, Hooks are the functions that make functional components work like class components
Hooks make react functional components so easy to use.

Developers prefer functional components over class components


Benefits of React Hooks

React hooks simplify the code , improves the readability , reusability and overall performance of the application


1.useState

useState is a react hook , which creates an 'state variable', which helps us to track state in components & updates the user
interface when state changes


2.useEffect

The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your components
Some examples of side effect are : Fetching data from API , Directly updating the DOM and Timers like setTimeout and setInterval


3.useRef hook

useRef is a react hook that allow us to create mutable variables which will not re-render the components
In simple term , when we declare variable using useRef and when variable value changes then it will not re-render the components

useRef is also used for accessing DOM elements.

4.useMemo Hooks

The React useMemo hook returns a memoized value, means it is like caching a value so that it doesn't
need to be recalculated
useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies gets updated
This can improve the performance of the application. There is one more hook in react to improve
performance, that is useCallback hook.
The useMemo and  useCallback hooks are similar. The main differenece is 
-useMemo returns a memoized value
-useCallback returns a memoized function


5.useCallback hooks

It is a hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders
It means, when we use useCallback hook , it doesn't create multiple instance of same function
when rerender happens
Instead of creating a new instance of the function, it provides the cached function on re-render of
the components.


Referential equality (also known as reference equality) refers to the concept of comparing two variables to check whether they refer to the exact same object in memory. In contrast to value equality, which checks whether two objects have the same content, referential equality checks if they are pointing to the same memory address (i.e., they are the same instance of an object).

Example:
In JavaScript and many other languages, referential equality is used when comparing complex types such as objects or arrays. Here's a simple example to explain:

javascript
Copy code
const obj1 = { name: "Suyash" };
const obj2 = { name: "Suyash" };
const obj3 = obj1;

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false, because they are different objects in memory
console.log(obj1 === obj3); // true, because they point to the same object in memory
In this case:

obj1 and obj2 contain the same content, but they are not referentially equal because they are stored in different memory locations.
obj1 and obj3 are referentially equal because they refer to the same object in memory (i.e., obj3 is a reference to obj1).
Referential Equality vs Value Equality:
Referential equality: Compares if two variables point to the same object in memory (same reference).
Value equality: Compares if two objects have the same content, regardless of where they are stored in memory.
For primitive types like numbers, strings, and booleans, referential equality and value equality often coincide because they are immutable. But for objects, arrays, and functions, referential equality differs from value equality.

Referential equality is significant when dealing with immutability, object mutations, and state management in React and other frameworks.


6.useContext Hook

useContext is a react hook that allows you to access data from any component without explicitly
passing it down through props at every component level
useContext is used to manage Global Data in the react app
You use this to avoid child->parent->child prop passing
means avoid sending data in every unnecessary nested component level

Step 1: create context
Step 2: provides context
Step 3: consuming context

Context API can be used to share any kind of data including functions,arrays,objects
Most common use of Context API is to share current theme of an application to all its component
or to share the  authenticated users with all our component or to share a result of API call with all of our component
which will reduce the number of API calls

7.useReducer Hook

useReducer is similar to useState, But instead of providing state and setter function. It provides state
and dispatch.
useReducer Hook accepts two arguments
-Reducer function
-Initial state
and returns: Current state and Dispatch methods

The reducer function specifies how the state gets updated

when we use useState hook, we update state variables using setter function , when we use useReducer
We can efficiently update state variable for different actions.

8.useLayoutEffect hook

useLayoutEffect works similar to useEffect, but it is called before the user interface gets mounted.
useEffect gets called after printing the DOM elements , but useLayoutEffect gets called before printing the
DOM elements
example: if you create a layout using DOM elements and want to change the layout color using useEffect then
it will display the DOM element and after it will change which will cause flickering issue

so when change color using useLayoutEffect then first it will change the color and after that, it will display DOM element
or web page 

useLayoutEffect can be used for calling APIs, printing the DOM elements and fixing the flickering

But react docs says useLayoutEffect can hurt the performance of an app , so recommended to use , useEffect

9.Custom Hooks

React allows us to create  our own hook which is known as Custom hook
Why do we create Custom Hook ?

lets say you have component logic that need to be used by multiple components, so extract that logic to create a custom hook
