JavaScript is a language of Browser jisse Browser ko interactivity dete hai
we execute it in Browser, 
Browser has JavaScript engine (Chrome has Chrome V8 engine)
JavaScript Behaves differently in different Browser kyuki sabke apne apne engine hai

V8 engine ko extract kiya and C++ ke andhar machine functionality hai , uske wajase JavaScript bahar execute

JavaScript can talk to native machine because of C++ means JavaScript se bhi file handling dekh sakte
Jo C++ machine level pe kar sakti hai wo JavaScript bhi kar sakti kyuki internally C++ hi use karti hai

JavaScript c++ ke saath embed , JavaScript v8 engine ko use karke execute ho raha hai which is inside C++

We can now create our own web servers

NodeJS is a runtimme environment for JavaScript (jiske andhar JavaScript ko execute kar sakte hai)


Prerequisites for NodeJS -> JavaScript
